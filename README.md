# Cloud Misconfiguration Scanner with Policy Mapping

## Overview
A cloud security tool that scans an AWS account for common misconfigurations, maps each finding to relevant NIST CSF and CIS AWS Benchmark controls, and generates plain-English remediation reports using an LLM. Built to practice the technical and risk-translation skills used in cloud security and security consulting roles.

## Architecture

## Setup
1. Create a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate it and install dependencies: `pip install boto3`
3. Configure AWS credentials for a least-privilege IAM user (see `/policies` for the exact custom policy used — deliberately scoped to read-only actions, not the AWS-managed ReadOnlyAccess policy)
4. Run `python detectors.py`

## Usage

## Findings Detected
- **Public S3 buckets** — checks Block Public Access configuration and bucket policy for public access grants
- **Open security groups** — checks inbound rules for unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) on sensitive ports (SSH, RDP, and common database ports), rather than flagging all open ports indiscriminately

## Design Decisions
- **Custom least-privilege IAM policy instead of AWS-managed ReadOnlyAccess** — scoped to only the specific read/describe/list actions each detector needs, minimizing blast radius if credentials were ever compromised.
- **Explicit error-code handling rather than blanket exception catching** — the S3 detector distinguishes a genuinely missing Block Public Access configuration from other failures (e.g., an IAM permissions gap), so a scan failure is reported as "unverified" rather than silently mislabeled as a security finding.
